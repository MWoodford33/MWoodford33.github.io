The first week of [Awesome Inc](https://www.awesomeinc.org/) coding bootcamp was nothing like what I expected it to be, but in a good way. The standup sessions each day taught me that most of my classmates were, indeed, not miles ahead of me, but were in fact in the same place as me for much of the time... which was kinda lost. This first week has been a wonderful experience as far as support from the staff and other students, and I am so grateful.
I am excited to become more comfortable using Github and understanding it's commands, as well as delving in to the different languages in more depth. I'm also excited to meet everyone in person as I have been in Florida on vacation for the entire first week. ![FloridaSunset](watersunset.jpeg)

What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
I'd love to be able to make a mobile app for my aesthetician's office that showed people what they would look like after getting a procedure done (liposuction, face-lift, breast augmentation, etc)
What are you struggling with?
I'm riding the struggle bus hard when it comes to JavaScript and all its various syntax and functions
How do you solve a problem? 
When I have a problem I generally turn to my classmates/teachers by way of the Slack app 'Help' channel.  I also sometimes utilize "Bob Doss" the ChatGPT bot that our insturctors gave explicit parameters to so that it doesn't give me direct answers, but leads me down a different path of thinking.
What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
I'm a big believer in giving the brain a break.  When I'm stuck, I'll take the dog on a walk, twirl in my chair for a while, take a 10 minute rest, or listen to some chill lo-fi music.  Anything that will get let my brain wind down for a bit, and allow me to come back refreshed.
