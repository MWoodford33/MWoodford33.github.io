## Hot Diggity
The first week of [Awesome](https://www.awesomeinc.org/) Inc coding bootcamp was nothing like what I expected it to be, but in a good way. The standup sessions each day taught me that most of my classmates were, indeed, not miles ahead of me, but were in fact in the same place as me for much of the time... which was kinda lost. This first week has been a wonderful experience as far as support from the staff and other students, and I am so grateful.
I am excited to become more comfortable using Github and understanding it's commands, as well as delving in to the different languages in more depth. I'm also excited to meet everyone in person as I have been in Florida on vacation for the entire first ![week.](watersunset.jpeg)
